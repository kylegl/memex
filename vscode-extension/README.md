# Memex - Agent Memory

Persistent memory for AI coding agents. Your agent remembers what it learned across sessions.

## What it does

Every time your AI agent finishes a task, it saves insights as atomic knowledge cards with `[[bidirectional links]]`. Next session, it recalls relevant cards before starting work — building on what it already knows instead of starting from scratch.

No vector database, no embeddings — just markdown files your agent (and you) can read.

## MCP Tools

This extension registers a MCP server that gives your AI agent 6 tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memex_search` | Search cards by keyword |
| `memex_read` | Read a card's full content |
| `memex_write` | Write or update a card |
| `memex_links` | Show link graph stats |
| `memex_archive` | Archive a card |
| `memex_init` | Add memex workflow to AGENTS.md |

## Graph View

Explore your knowledge network with an interactive force-directed graph:

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- VS Code 1.100+

## Quick Start

1. Install this extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. The MCP server starts automatically
3. Ask your AI agent to "remember" something — it will use memex tools
4. Run `memex init` in your project to add workflow instructions to AGENTS.md

## Sync Across Devices

```bash
npx @touchskyer/memex sync --init
```

Cards are stored in `~/.memex/cards/`. Sync them via git to access from any device or editor.

## Browse Your Memory

```bash
npx @touchskyer/memex serve
```

Opens a visual timeline + graph view at `localhost:3939`.

## Cross-Platform

All editors share the same `~/.memex/cards/` directory. A card written in VS Code Copilot is instantly available in Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or any other MCP client.

| Platform | Integration |
|----------|------------|
| **VS Code / Copilot** | This extension |
| **Claude Code** | Plugin (best experience) |
| **Cursor** | MCP Server |
| **Codex** | MCP Server |
