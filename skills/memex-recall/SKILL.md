description: Load prior knowledge from Zettelkasten memory before starting any task.
whenToUse: At the START of every new conversation or task, BEFORE doing any work. This skill loads prior knowledge from the Zettelkasten memory system. Without it, you have no memory of past sessions. Invoke proactively — do not wait for the user to ask.

# Memory Recall

You have access to a Zettelkasten memory system via the `memex` CLI. Before starting this task, search your memory for relevant prior knowledge.

## Tools Available

Two equivalent interfaces exist — use whichever your environment supports:

| CLI (Claude Code with memex in PATH) | MCP tool (VSCode / Cursor / any MCP client) |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `memex read index`                    | `memex_read` with slug `index`               |
| `memex search <query>`               | `memex_search` with query arg                |
| `memex read <slug>`                   | `memex_read` with slug arg                   |
| `memex search` (no args)             | `memex_search` with no args                  |

The rest of this skill uses CLI syntax for brevity. Substitute MCP tool calls if CLI is unavailable.

## Process

```dot
digraph recall {
    "Task received" -> "memex read index";
    "memex read index" -> "Index exists?" [shape=diamond];
    "Index exists?" -> "Scan index for relevant concepts/slugs" [label="yes"];
    "Index exists?" -> "Fallback: generate 2-3 search queries" [label="no"];
    "Scan index for relevant concepts/slugs" -> "memex read <card>" ;
    "Fallback: generate 2-3 search queries" -> "memex search <query>";
    "memex search <query>" -> "Review summaries";
    "Review summaries" -> "Relevant cards found?" [shape=diamond];
    "Relevant cards found?" -> "memex read <card>" [label="yes"];
    "Relevant cards found?" -> "More queries to try?" [label="no"];
    "memex read <card>" -> "See [[links]] in content";
    "See [[links]] in content" -> "Links worth following?" [shape=diamond];
    "Links worth following?" -> "memex read <linked-card>" [label="yes"];
    "Links worth following?" -> "Enough context?" [label="no"];
    "memex read <linked-card>" -> "See [[links]] in content";
    "Enough context?" -> "More queries to try?" [label="no"];
    "More queries to try?" -> "Generate new query" [label="yes"];
    "Generate new query" -> "memex search <query>";
    "More queries to try?" -> "Summarize findings, proceed with task" [label="no"];
    "Enough context?" -> "Summarize findings, proceed with task" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Step 1: Read the keyword index

Run `memex read index` first. The root index is intentionally compact and acts as the primary entrypoint.

In nested-slug setups, it may mostly route through nested `.../index` MOCs (e.g. `[[notes/index]]`, `[[project/index]]`) instead of listing every card directly. Follow those nested index links as needed.

If the index doesn't exist yet (card not found), fall back to Step 2.

### Step 2: Targeted reads or keyword search

- **If index exists**: Pick the most relevant slugs from the root index. If it points to nested MOCs, read those MOCs first, then drill down to target cards.
- **If no index**: Generate 2-3 search keywords (try both Chinese and English terms) and run `memex search <keyword>` for each.

### Step 3: Follow links

When you read a card and see `[[links]]` in the prose, decide if they're worth following. If yes, `memex read <linked-slug>`.

### Step 4: Summarize and proceed

When you have enough context, summarize your findings and proceed with the task.

## Guardrails

- **max_hops: 3** — Do not follow links more than 3 levels deep
- **max_cards_read: 20** — Do not read more than 20 cards in a single recall
- If you hit either limit, stop and work with what you have

## Counting Rules

- Hop 0 = cards found directly via index or `memex search`. Following a `[[link]]` from there is hop 1, etc.
- Keep a running count of `memex read` calls. If you've read 20 cards, stop immediately.

## Important

- Always start with `memex read index` — it is the root navigation entrypoint
- Generate search queries in BOTH Chinese and English to maximize recall
- If search returns nothing useful, that's fine — proceed without memory context
- Summarize what you found before proceeding, so the findings are in your context
